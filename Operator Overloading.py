# Operator Overloading is a feature in Python that allows developers to redefine the behavior of mathematical and comparison operators for custom data types. This means that you can use the standard mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, etc.) and comparison operators (>, <, ==, etc.) in your own classes, just as you would for built-in data types like int, float, and str.



# You can overload an operator in Python by defining special methods in your class. These methods are identified by their names, which start and end with double underscores (__). Here are some of the most commonly overloaded operators and their corresponding special methods:
# + : __add__
# - : __sub__
# * : __mul__
# / : __truediv__
# < : __lt__
# > : __gt__
# == : __eq__
# # 

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
